# Introduction to Multiomics Data Integration and Visualisation

This repository contains the project designed by Jacques Serizay to be 
taught at the EBI for the course "Introduction to Multiomics 
Data Integration and Visualisation" in March 2020. 

To build the HTML version of the instructions (located in the doc folder), 
the following command has been used: 
```r
rmarkdown::render('doc/intructions.Rmd', output_format = 'rmdformats::readthedown')
```
