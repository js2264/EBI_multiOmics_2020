  abstract = "Multicellular organisms are composed of tissues that have
              distinct functions requiring specialized proteomes. To define the
              proteome of a live animal with tissue and subcellular resolution,
              we adapted a localized proteomics technology for use in the
              multicellular model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. This
              approach couples tissue- and location-specific expression of the
              enzyme ascorbate peroxidase (APX), which enables proximity-based
              protein labeling in vivo, and quantitative proteomics to identify
              tissue- and subcellular-restricted proteomes. We identified and
              localized more than 3000 proteins from strains of C. elegans
              expressing APX in either the nucleus or cytoplasm of the
              intestine, epidermis, body wall muscle, or pharyngeal muscle. We
              also identified several hundred proteins that were specifically
              localized to one of the four tissues analyzed or specifically
              localized to the cytoplasm or the nucleus. This approach resulted
              in the identification both of proteins with previously
              characterized localizations and of those not known to localize to
              the nucleus or cytoplasm. Further, we confirmed the tissue- and
              subcellular-specific localization of a subset of identified
              proteins using green fluorescent protein tagging and fluorescence
              microscopy, validating our in vivo proximity-based proteomics
              technique. Together, these results demonstrate a new approach
              that enables the tissue- and subcellular-specific identification
              and quantification of proteins within a live animal.",
